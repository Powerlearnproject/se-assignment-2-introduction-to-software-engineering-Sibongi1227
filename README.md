# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

A: Software engineering is  the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.cIt differs from traditional programming in that while traditional programming is centered around the code, software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintenance, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach to software development. https://medium.com/@antonellosemeraro/heres-the-real-difference-between-programming-and-software-engineering.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development.
What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall is good for short-term projects while agile is good for long-term projects

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing requirements in the engineering design process. 
The process has the following four stages:
Elicit requirements: Elicitation is the process of being informed of all of the key information associated with the project.
Requirements specification: This is when the functional and nonfunctional project requirements are gathered.
Verification and validation: During this stage, the client’s requirements are verified if they meet the project goals.
Requirements management: During this stage, all the requirements are analyzed, documented for developers, and prioritized to communicate with the client.qu

Requirements engineering is important because it sets a specific path for project development. Also, clients may have a long list of ideas, features, and functionalities when building new software, and requirements engineering gives them a framework for fitting into these ideas.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity specifies the division of software into separate modules that are differently named and addressed and are integrated later on to obtain the completely functional software. 

Modularity can improve maintainability by separating different functions in a software system into different units - modules - it becomes possible to change or correct a flaw in a module without affecting the other parts of the system. One can work on one module without affecting the others, and debugging and maintenance become simplified and easy. Modularity can improve scalability by allowing additional modules that can be added to enable more features or expand on existing features and functions. https://www.javatpoint.com/software-engineering-software-design-principles

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystem
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

It is crucial in software development because quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher-quality software products

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.It is important in that it helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/

Below is a list of popular version control systems and their features:

Helix Core — Helix Core, one of the leading version control examples, is a centralized version control system by Perforce Software. It’s the leading version control system for game developers and is also used in media & entertainment and semiconductor design, among other industries. It offers visibility to collaborative teams, showing when others are using the same data, and it provides a locking strategy to prevent the overwriting of critical data. It is free for up to five users.

Git — Git is a widely popular, distributed control system for developers. Git source control is open-source and therefor free to use. It offers easy branching and is great for small projects but has file and repo size limits.

SVN — SVN (short for Subversion) is another free, open-source version control system developed by Apache. It is a centralized version control system. It offers good concurrent development processes, but its branch and merge functions are not strong.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
